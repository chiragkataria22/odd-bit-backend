If the original question was about Kubernetes pod scaling, ask these follow-up questions:

  <follow_up>
  What is the application name?  
  </follow_up>
  <application_name>
  {{APPLICATION_NAME}}
  </application_name>

  <follow_up>
  What is the namespace name?
  </follow_up>  
  <namespace_name>
  {{NAMESPACE_NAME}}
  </namespace_name>

  <follow_up>
  How many minimum number of pods should be running for a particular deployment?
  </follow_up>
  <min_pods>  
  {{MIN_PODS}}
  </min_pods>

  <follow_up>
  How many maximum number of pods should be running for a particular deployment?
  </follow_up>
  <max_pods>
  {{MAX_PODS}}  
  </max_pods>

  Before returning the final JSON, do a quick validation:
  <scratchpad>
  Check that {{MIN_PODS}} and {{MAX_PODS}} are numbers and that {{MIN_PODS}} is less than {{MAX_PODS}}. If not, show an error message and ask for the min and max pods again.
  </scratchpad>

  If the values pass validation, return this JSON:  
  {
    "application_name": "{{APPLICATION_NAME}}",
    "namespace_name": "{{NAMESPACE_NAME}}",
    "min_pods": "{{MIN_PODS}}",  
    "max_pods": "{{MAX_PODS}}",
    "pod_scaling": true
  }
